## About MarketplaceKit

MarketplaceKit is a platform for building different types of online marketplaces. MarketplaceKit attempts to reduce the development effort required to build product, rental, service and listing marketplaces such as Etsy, AirBnB, Handy and Zillow. It does this by attempting to cover the main components a marketplace needs, including the following:

- Powerful search across multiple fields, geolocation and custom fields
- Geolocalization for users and listings
- Frontend listing creation and browsing
- User profiles
- Direct messaging between users
- Multilingual functionality
